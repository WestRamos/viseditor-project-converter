Grouping entities allows you to better organize scenes. Multiple groups can be nested.

To group select two or more entities then from menu select `Edit -> Group`. New Group will be created and selected. Entity Properties view will change, you will be able to set group name and see group id. You will also see a Group entry in Outline panel. To ungroup select group and choose `Edit -> Ungroup`.

You can enter group to edit it contents, to do so right click group and select `Enter Into Group`. A breadcrumb will appear at the top of the scene, informing you of your current active group. You can click on breadcrumb elements to quickly exit from group edit mode or to switch editing to parent group.

After entering into group you can edit separate entities, add them or remove. To exit group use breadcrumb (see above) or click any other entity that isn't in current group.

Entities in groups don't use local positions relative to group position, they are still using world position.
