VisEditor LibGDX runtime (called VisRuntime) allows to easily load project exported form VisEditor. 

VisRuntime uses Artemis-odb for entity-component-system framework. You can refer to [artemis-odb wiki](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb/wiki) if you would like to learn more about it. You don't have to add Artemis as separate dependency for your project, it is already included in VisRuntime.
